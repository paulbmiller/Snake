# Snake

Reinforcement Learning applied to a 20x20 Snake game with Deep Q Learning.

Used ideas and some code from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfNxXlO6BiA.

Does not work as anticipated. Is barely able to eat the first fruit consistently (the initial position and direction of the snake is random). Maybe it could work with some tweaking of the optimizer, reward system, neural net model, loss function, learning rate, environment modelling, state definition, etc.
